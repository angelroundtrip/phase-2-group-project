Project: Reaction Journals

Creators: Angel Rosario, Lorenzo Sorrells, and Maximilien Marton

Here you will find our Phase 2 REACT project. We created a diary web app:
This app allows the user to create and log their diary entries to JSON db.
When viewing entries, the user can sort the entries by date or whether entries were favorited or not.
The user can also store their contact information in the My Info portion, which is a homage of sorts to the 
"if found, please contact me" page in paper diaries.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
